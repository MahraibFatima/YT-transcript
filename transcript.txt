[00:00] hey my name is Paul and today I'm going

[00:01] to show you how to use hidden apis via

[00:03] nadn to get free YouTube transcripts

[00:05] let's get right into it so step number

[00:07] one is going to be to go ahead and sign

[00:09] up for an NN account if you don't have

[00:11] one already you can do this exact

[00:13] process VI make.com as well I'm just

[00:15] using Ann and this example and I'm going

[00:17] to go ahead and create a new workflow

[00:19] and make that OB be a

[00:21] scenario and I'm just going to add our

[00:23] trigger which is going to be trigger

[00:25] manually and then for this example uh

[00:28] I'm going to use com AI YouTube

[00:31] transcripts generator just so we can

[00:34] demonstrate this but you can do this for

[00:36] many different things and many different

[00:37] softwares so it doesn't necessarily have

[00:39] to be com and YouTube transcripts it can

[00:41] be a whole host of different things but

[00:43] the concept is what's important and the

[00:45] skill of knowing how to do this so I'm

[00:48] going to go ahead and click on comei

[00:49] YouTube transcript generator you can see

[00:51] free and fast and if I go to my

[00:56] YouTube I'm going to go to your Channel

[01:00] and then I'm going grab my most video

[01:03] backspace this copy this and then paste

[01:06] it in my YouTube Ur all and generate it

[01:08] you can see we have our full transcript

[01:10] from the video in seconds and it's free

[01:13] but what we want to do is uh imagine if

[01:15] you just used an appify scraper to

[01:17] scrape a YouTube profile and there's

[01:18] like 100 plus videos right and then you

[01:21] want to get all the transcripts back

[01:23] from that specific Channel and then

[01:25] repurpose the transcripts into a tweet

[01:28] to promote it via on your Channel

[01:29] Channel or repurpose somebody else's

[01:31] videos transcripts into your own tweets

[01:34] or maybe a blog post or something the

[01:36] the possibilities with this are

[01:37] literally endless and that's exactly I'm

[01:39] going to show you because you don't want

[01:39] to be like oh okay video copy boom put

[01:42] it over here then drag it do Google doc

[01:44] then go over to chat gbt like that's why

[01:46] we have automation so what we're going

[01:48] to do is right click and bring up the

[01:50] developer tools with inspect I'm going

[01:52] to refresh this

[01:54] page and then paste in the same YouTube

[01:56] all and then click on generate and you

[02:00] can see we have this uh status 2001 X

[02:03] xhr type and then I'm going to go to it

[02:07] and you can see we have a request URL

[02:09] with a post we got 200 back so it means

[02:11] it worked and then if I go over to

[02:13] response you can see in Json or

[02:16] JavaScript object and notation we have

[02:19] the the transcript just like we want it

[02:20] if I go to payload we have a Json

[02:22] payload so if you've ever done an hgp

[02:25] requests with make or NAD you're going

[02:27] to know that we need a request youur all

[02:28] we need a method and then we need to

[02:30] payload sometimes we need headers like

[02:32] authentication or cookies and stuff like

[02:34] that but in this example you actually

[02:35] don't so what we're going to do is come

[02:38] over to naden add an HTTP node it's

[02:41] going to be HTTP request and then if I

[02:44] come over here you can see the request

[02:45] method is post so I'm going to change

[02:49] the method to

[02:50] post and then I'm going to copy this

[02:52] request you

[02:54] all paste it in here and going turn on

[02:57] send body and change this specific body

[02:59] to using Json and then if I go to

[03:01] payload I'm going to copy this actually

[03:04] uh copy this and come over to chat gbt

[03:07] and just tell it format Json boom and

[03:11] then we're going to copy what it gives

[03:12] us boom and then I'm just going to paste

[03:16] this in and this is actually good to go

[03:18] so if I go ahead and click on test

[03:20] step what we should get is our

[03:22] transcript back yes so we get our

[03:24] transcript back uh and what we can do is

[03:27] I'm going to set up a Google sheet and

[03:28] we're just going to iterate through a

[03:30] couple different videos and then save

[03:31] their transcripts next to them so I'm

[03:34] going to go to this account because I

[03:35] have this one linked and then go to

[03:38] Google Sheets create a blank

[03:40] spreadsheet I'm going to say channels to

[03:44] or videos to

[03:48] transcribe and then I'm going to add a

[03:50] URL header and then I'm going to add a

[03:53] transcript

[03:55] header I I spelled the whole thing so

[03:58] transcript Andora hter so we're going to

[04:00] have our URL here and then we'll have

[04:01] our transcripts here so it's going to

[04:03] search through these different URLs and

[04:04] then put their transcripts right here

[04:06] all for free so I'm going to just bold

[04:09] these headers make them a little bit

[04:10] bigger and then I'm going to plug in a

[04:12] couple of my YouTube videos so we'll

[04:14] copy this most recent

[04:17] one we'll go to this one this one and

[04:20] this one what's going on guys my name I

[04:22] think four is enough to just demonstrate

[04:24] it and and how fast it's going to be as

[04:26] well um the fact what's going on guys my

[04:28] name really cool so boom uh let's make

[04:32] sure there's no duplicates here yeah

[04:34] we're good guys

[04:37] okay boom all right so this is all good

[04:40] to go we have four different videos and

[04:41] then we'll have four different

[04:42] transcripts for each of or for them so

[04:45] I'm going to close these

[04:47] windows and then instead of hard coding

[04:49] this we're going to actually want the

[04:50] variable for the URL so I'm going to

[04:52] delete this connection add a node I'm

[04:54] going to search for Google

[04:56] Sheets it's going to be actually get row

[04:59] which is basic the search row module and

[05:01] make and I'm going to choose a document

[05:04] videos to transcribe I didn't rename the

[05:05] sheet so it's going to be by default

[05:07] sheet one if I go and click on test

[05:11] step what we get back is the different

[05:13] URLs and you can see the transcript is

[05:15] empty right now that's what we want to

[05:16] change but we have the different URLs

[05:17] and we can dynamically access them with

[05:19] this URL uh variable so I'm going to

[05:22] connect this to the HTTP request node

[05:24] I'll rename

[05:26] this uh get transcripts

[05:31] okay so I'm going to say list videos

[05:35] this one and we're going to add another

[05:36] Google Sheets module after this but

[05:38] first we have to set this one up so I'm

[05:41] going to change this from Simply card

[05:43] coding the URL to grabbing this URL from

[05:46] the list videos you'll probably need to

[05:48] run this one so that it's populated and

[05:50] then I'm just going to move this up here

[05:51] too in between these quotations for the

[05:53] video ID and let's go ahead and try

[05:56] testing this step so test step

[06:00] and we get the transcrip back so this is

[06:02] successfully executed it actually got us

[06:03] back all of our different ones but

[06:05] that's fine so I'm going to close this

[06:07] add another add another module and I'm

[06:10] going to search for Google Sheets again

[06:11] we're actually going to add these

[06:13] transcripts to the Google sheet so right

[06:17] here we have URL we want the transcript

[06:18] right here so it's going to be a pend or

[06:21] update a row in a sheet I'm going to say

[06:24] update row I'm going to choose this

[06:27] sheet is going to be sheet one

[06:30] it's going to fetch these columns and

[06:31] I'm going to match it on URL and then

[06:34] feed in this URL boom and then the

[06:38] transcript is is just going to be this

[06:39] transcript from the get transcripts

[06:41] module if we go and test

[06:47] step okay if I go to here we have

[06:49] successfully mapped in the transcripts

[06:51] for all of the videos so I'm just going

[06:53] to delete these for now and we're going

[06:55] to run it live so I'm going to exit this

[06:57] out end to end I'm going to save it I'm

[07:00] going to call

[07:01] this

[07:03] uh

[07:04] free

[07:07] transcripts transcripts boom and it's

[07:11] saved if I go a and click on test

[07:14] workflow we're going to wait here and in

[07:16] just a second we're going to have all

[07:17] the transcripts

[07:19] back so boom boom boom boom boom okay

[07:22] this is this is good so I think in the

[07:24] future what I'm going to do this may

[07:25] actually be my next video uh I'm going

[07:27] to show you how to scrape through a list

[07:29] list of different YouTube channels get

[07:31] the videos and then scrape the videos

[07:33] and then get the transcripts as well as

[07:35] repurpose them into the tweets because I

[07:36] think that could be an absolutely mental

[07:38] system but this is just like stage one

[07:40] how to get the transcripts back into a

[07:42] Google sheet hey if you enjoyed the
